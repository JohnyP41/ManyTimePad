## ManyTimePad
Many time pad attack - one time pad stream cipher key finder tool

# What works?
Given a otp message collection of cipher text it can decrypt 'em all!


# TODO

- Docs
----------------------------
  1. a bit of background
  2. where is otp badly used?
  
- fix spaghetti code:
----------------------------
  1. make good objects
  2. use builder pattern
  
- Expicitly build key cracker in mtp class
----------------------------------------
 
# OTHER KIND OF ANALYSIS
1. frequency and two - three chars words attack
2. rigorous probability calculation
3. bayesian calculations? maybe...
